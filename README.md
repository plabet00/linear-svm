# Linear Support Vector Machine in Python

This Python script implements a simple linear support vector machine algorithm in combination with stohastic gradient descent.\
To test its accuracy it uses [this](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) dataset which contains data about patients and if they do or do not have a hearth condition.\
The implemented algorithm shows an accuracy of about 88% in guessing if a patient has a heart condition on the above mentioned dataset.\

## Requirements

-numpy
-pandas
-statsmodels
-sklearn(only for data manipulation)
